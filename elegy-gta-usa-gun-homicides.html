                    Elegy was a gaming mod for Grand Theft Auto V that reenacted each day the total gun homicides for
                    one
                    year from July 4th, 2018 to July 4th, 2019. Gun homicide data was scraped continuously from the Gun
                    Violence Archive. Gun homicide totals are revised daily on this website, this data was then fed
                    directly, algorithmically, into the project—starting at 0 each midnight, each day the new total body
                    count since January 1st was reenacted in it's totality and so on. The project launched on July 4th,
                    2018
                    when there were 7,293 gun homicides in the United States—by the end of 2018 this number will grew to
                    14,730, on January 1st, 2019 the homicide count for the year began anew at 0. The project was live
                    screened on Twitch.tv. The work was accompanied by a looping soundtrack of the first radio recording
                    of
                    “God Bless America” as sung by Kate Smith in 1938.</p>
